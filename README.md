## Use
Enter the names of your 3 or 2 images to the utility and... Magic!

Example: Concrete01_AO.png Concrete01_RG.png Concrete01_MT.png

Remind that you can leave BLUE(Metallic) empty and it will be fully black.
## Prerrequisites

For editing the file you will need Python 3.11, Colorama module and Pillow:

`pip install Pillow`  
`pip install Colorama` 

## Download
Grab the latest release on: https://github.com/unaigonzalezz/IMG2PBR/releases/tag/Release

## Known issues

Errors are expected to appear, the utility is on a early stage and I will continue with the development.

If you have strange numbers on the headline of the utility, you need to install Python, otherwise you won't see the colours.
